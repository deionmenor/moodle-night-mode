This repo contains CSS code for making the Ateneo de Manila University Moodle website more pleasant for those browsing at night.

## INSTALLATION

I recommend downloading [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) for Google Chrome or Firefox. Stylus injects its own CSS into the webpage you're on so you can essentially make the website look however you like!

[You can then INSTALL my ADMU Moodle Night Mode theme here](https://userstyles.org/styles/164201/admu-moodle-night-mode).
